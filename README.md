# compile-ts-to-js
(Hobby) Here is a simple example of what happens when you compile a .ts to a .js file 

In order to generate tsconfig.json 
```
tsc init 
``` 

Compile the `.ts`file to `.js` with 
```
tsc compile-this-to-js.ts
```

On stackoverflow there is a discussion about an easier compilation. But which is not recommended by Microsoft:
